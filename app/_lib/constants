    // So much so, the GPT tab on our PCs practically never closes! Being a second year student enrolled in a Computer Science Engineering Programme, I witness this phenomena nearly every day. With my pals, rushing through their assignments and DSA practicals by hard-core copy-pasting codes from their very own, aforementioned saviour, ChatGPT. Which, of course, on a moral ground is incorrect and shouldn’t be this way in the first place. But where my problem lies, is actually on a different and more important front- the practical aspect. Getting your labs done and dusted and your submissions aligned is important, but really? You call yourselves engineers (in the making), without having to put yourselves through the ‘pain’ of thinking and actually engineering? Self-sabotage much? I could write an entire article on this, but let’s not deviate from the actual topic at hand...",

    // and the ongoing challenges faced by women in tech. This blog post aims to provide a thought-provoking exploration of the 'Silicon Sisterhood', showcasing the strides women are making and the impact they have on the tech landscape. According to a 2023 report by the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), women hold approximately 26% of computing jobs in the United States. While this number has increased over the past decade, it still reflects a significant gender gap. Moreover, women of color are particularly underrepresented, making up only 3% of the computing workforce. This disparity highlights the urgent need for systemic change within the industry. Research shows that diversity in tech teams leads to greater innovation and better decision-making. A study by McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to experience above-average profitability...",
